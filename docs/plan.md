# 5-Phase Development Plan

This document outlines a 5-phase approach for software development projects.

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis
- **Objective:** To understand and document the project requirements.
- **Activities:**
    - Gather requirements from stakeholders.
    - Analyze and document requirements.
    - Create a project scope document.
    - Define project goals and deliverables.

## Phase 2: Design
- **Objective:** To design the software architecture and user interface.
- **Activities:**
    - Create system design specifications.
    - Design the database schema.
    - Develop wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
    - Create a technical design document.

## Phase 3: Implementation
- **Objective:** To build the software based on the design specifications.
- **Activities:**
    - Set up the development environment.
    - Write code for the application features.
    - Perform unit testing.
    - Integrate different modules.

## Phase 4: Testing
- **Objective:** To ensure the software is free of defects and meets the requirements.
- **Activities:**
    - Conduct integration testing.
    - Perform system testing.
    - Carry out user acceptance testing (UAT).
    - Fix any identified bugs.

## Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance
- **Objective:** To release the software to users and provide ongoing support.
- **Activities:**
    - Deploy the application to the production environment.
    - Monitor system performance.
    - Provide user support and training.
    - Plan for future enhancements and updates.

# Quanta_Pie Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Quanta_Pie project, a text-based C++ adventure game.

## Phase 1: Core Engine Development
- **Objective:** Build the foundational C++ engine for the game.
- **Activities:**
    - Implement the main game loop.
    - Create a robust text parser for player input.
    - Develop a state management system to track player progress and game world status.
    - Design a modular structure to allow for easy expansion of the story and features.

## Phase 2: Story and Content Creation
- **Objective:** Develop the narrative and game world.
- **Activities:**
    - Write the main storyline and branching narrative paths.
    - Create detailed descriptions of locations, characters, and items.
    - Define the puzzles and challenges within the game.
    - Ensure the story aligns with the themes of the Quanta Series.

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation
- **Objective:** Implement the key gameplay features.
- **Activities:**
    - Code the logic for dynamic story paths based on player choices.
    - Implement the system for multiple endings.
    - Add any additional gameplay mechanics, such as an inventory system or character stats.
    - Integrate the story content with the core engine.

## Phase 4: Gameplay and Balance Testing
- **Objective:** Test the game for bugs, and to ensure a compelling gameplay experience.
- **Activities:**
    - Conduct thorough playthroughs of all story branches.
    - Identify and fix any bugs or logical inconsistencies in the narrative.
    - Balance the difficulty of puzzles and challenges.
    - Gather feedback from playtesters to improve the game.

## Phase 5: Build System and Release
- **Objective:** Finalize the build process and prepare the game for release.
- **Activities:**
    - Create a cross-platform build system (e.g., using CMake).
    - Write clear and comprehensive build and run instructions in the README.md.
    - Package the game for distribution.
    - Tag a version 1.0 release.
