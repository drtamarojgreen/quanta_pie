# 5-Phase Development Plan

This document outlines a 5-phase approach for software development projects.

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis
- **Objective:** To understand and document the project requirements.
- **Activities:**
    - Gather requirements from stakeholders.
    - Analyze and document requirements.
    - Create a project scope document.
    - Define project goals and deliverables.

## Phase 2: Design
- **Objective:** To design the software architecture and user interface.
- **Activities:**
    - Create system design specifications.
    - Design the database schema.
    - Develop wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
    - Create a technical design document.

## Phase 3: Implementation
- **Objective:** To build the software based on the design specifications.
- **Activities:**
    - Set up the development environment.
    - Write code for the application features.
    - Perform unit testing.
    - Integrate different modules.

## Phase 4: Testing
- **Objective:** To ensure the software is free of defects and meets the requirements.
- **Activities:**
    - Conduct integration testing.
    - Perform system testing.
    - Carry out user acceptance testing (UAT).
    - Fix any identified bugs.

## Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance
- **Objective:** To release the software to users and provide ongoing support.
- **Activities:**
    - Deploy the application to the production environment.
    - Monitor system performance.
    - Provide user support and training.
    - Plan for future enhancements and updates.
