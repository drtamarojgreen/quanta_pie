Quanta_Pie

A Text-Based C++ Adventure Game in the Quanta Series

Overview

Quanta_Pie is the latest installment in the Quanta Series, a collection of experimental, lightweight projects that mix science, play, and creativity.
This time, we’re diving into the deliciously mysterious world of text-based adventure.

In Quanta_Pie, you’ll navigate through a surreal landscape where logic, strategy, and curiosity matter more than graphics. Every choice alters the story, every action shifts the outcome, and the pie… well, the pie might just hold the key to everything.

Built entirely in modern C++17, Quanta_Pie is designed to be:

Lightweight – no unnecessary dependencies.

Fast – text is instant, interaction is smooth.

Expandable – modular code structure makes adding new story branches easy.

Features

Classic Text Adventure Gameplay: Explore, choose, and survive in a branching narrative.

Dynamic Story Paths: Multiple endings based on your decisions.

C++ Core: Demonstrates clean, modern C++ techniques in a fun, narrative-driven project.

Quanta Series Continuity: Threads of scientific and philosophical themes tie back into the broader Quanta universe.
